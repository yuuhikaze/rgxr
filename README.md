# RGXR

The backend of this project will be refactored in favor of more ad hoc data structures and idiomatic algorithms.

While most of the current functionality works, the codebase is admittedly messyâ€”a result of quick, improvised "vibe-coding."

That approach was valuable early on; it helped get things up and running without a clear plan. But as the project grows, it's become clear that this style doesn't scale well. Hence, the need for a more structured and maintainable foundation.
